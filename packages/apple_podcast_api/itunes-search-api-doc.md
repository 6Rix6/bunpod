# iTunes Search API

### Overview[]()

The Search API allows you to place search fields in your website to search for content within the iTunes Store and Apple Books Store. You can search for a variety of content; including books, movies, podcasts, music, music videos, audiobooks, and TV shows. You can also call an ID-based lookup request to create mappings between your content library and the digital catalog. Developers may use promotional content in the API, including previews of songs, music videos, album art and App icons only to promote store content and not for entertainment purposes. Use of sound samples and other assets from the API must be proximate to a store badge. See below for terms and conditions.

### Searching[]()

To search for content from a field in your website and display the results in your website, you must create a search field that passes a fully-qualified URL content request to the iTunes Store, parse the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format returned from the search, and display the results in your website.

The fully-qualified URL must have the following format:

`https://itunes.apple.com/search?parameterkeyvalue`

Where *parameterkeyvalue* can be one or more parameter key and value pairs indicating the details of your query.

To construct a parameter key and value pair, you must concatenate each parameter key with an equal sign (=) and a value string. For example: `key1=value1`. To create a string of parameter key and value pairs, you must concatenate each pair using an ampersand (&amp;). For example:

`key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3`

Note: When creating search fields and scripts for your website, you should use dynamic script tags for your xmlhttp script call requests. For example:

`<script src="https://.../search?parameterkeyvalue&callback="{name of JavaScript function in webpage}"/>`

The following table defines the parameter keys and values you can specify to search for content within the iTunes Store or Apple Books Store:

Parameter Key Description Required Values

term The URL-encoded text string you want to search for. For example: jack+johnson. Y Any URL-encoded text string. Note: URL encoding replaces spaces with the plus (+) character and all characters except the following are encoded: letters, numbers, periods (.), dashes (-), underscores (\_), and asterisks (\*).

country The two-letter country code for the store you want to search. The search uses the default store front for the specified country. For example: US. The default is US. Y See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) for a list of ISO Country Codes.

media The media type you want to search for. For example: movie. The default is all. N movie, podcast, music, musicVideo, audiobook, shortFilm, tvShow, software, ebook, all

entity The type of results you want returned, relative to the specified media type. For example: movieArtist for a movie media type search. The default is the track entity associated with the specified media type. N The following entities are available for each media type:

movie movieArtist, movie

podcast podcastAuthor, podcast, podcastEpisode

music musicArtist, musicTrack, album, musicVideo, mix, song  
Please note that “musicTrack” can include both songs and music videos in the results

musicVideo musicArtist, musicVideo

audiobook audiobookAuthor, audiobook

shortFilm shortFilmArtist, shortFilm

tvShow tvEpisode, tvSeason

software software, iPadSoftware, desktopSoftware

ebook ebook

all movie, album, allArtist, podcast, musicVideo, mix, audiobook, tvSeason, allTrack

attribute The attribute you want to search for in the stores, relative to the specified media type. For example, if you want to search for an artist by name specify entity=allArtist&amp;attribute=allArtistTerm. In this example, if you search for term=maroon, iTunes returns “Maroon 5” in the search results, instead of all artists who have ever recorded a song with the word “maroon” in the title.

The default is all attributes associated with the specified media type.

N The following attributes are available for each media type:

#### Notes[]()

- It is critical to encode your URLs correctly in order to be commissioned for partner links.
- To improve response times, minimize the number of search results the Search API returns by specifying an appropriate value for the limit parameter key.
- The Search API is limited to approximately 20 calls per minute (subject to change). If you require heavier usage, we suggest you consider using our Enterprise Partner Feed (EPF).  For more information, visit the [EPF documentation](epf) page.
- Large websites should set up caching logic for the search and lookup requests sent to the Search API. For an illustration, see Caching Architecture later in this document.

#### Search Examples[]()

The following are examples of fully-qualified URLs for specific search requests:

- To search for all Jack Johnson audio and video content (movies, podcasts, music, music videos, audiobooks, short films, and tv shows), your URL would look like the following:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack+johnson
- To search for all Jack Johnson audio and video content and return only the first 25 items, your URL would look like the following:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack+johnson&amp;limit=25
- To search for only Jack Johnson music videos, your URL would look like the following:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jack+johnson&amp;entity=musicVideo
- To search for all Jim Jones audio and video content and return only the results from the Canada iTunes Store, your URL would look like the following:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=jim+jones&amp;country=ca

#### Lookup Examples[]()

You can also create a lookup request to search for content in the stores based on iTunes IDs, UPCs/ EANs, and All Music Guide (AMG) IDs. ID-based lookups are faster and contain fewer false-positive results.

The following are examples of fully-qualified URLs for specific lookup requests:

- Look up Jack Johnson by iTunes artist ID:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=909253
- Look up Jack Johnson by AMG artist ID:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?amgArtistId=468749
- Look up multiple artists by their AMG artist IDs:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?amgArtistId=468749,5723
- Look up all albums for Jack Johnson:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=909253&amp;entity=album
- Look up multiple artists by their AMG artist IDs and get each artist’s top 5 albums:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?amgArtistId=468749,5723&amp;entity=album&amp;limit=5
- Look up multiple artists by their AMG artist IDs and get each artist’s 5 most recent songs:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?amgArtistId=468749,5723&amp;entity=song&amp;limit=5&amp;sort=recent
- Look up an album or video by its UPC:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?upc=720642462928
- Look up an album by its UPC, including the tracks on that album:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?upc=720642462928&amp;entity=song
- Look up an album by its AMG Album ID:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?amgAlbumId=15175,15176,15177,15178,15183,15184,15187,1519,15191,15195,15197,15198
- Look up a Movie by AMG Video ID:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?amgVideoId=17120
- Look up a book by its 13 digit ISBN:  
  https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?isbn=9780316069359

#### Understanding Search Results[]()

The Search API returns your search results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. JSON is built on two structures:

- A collection of name/value pairs, also known as an object; this concept is similar to a Java Map object, a Javascript Dictionary, or a Pearl/Ruby hash. An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs, beginning with a left brace ( { ) and ending with a right brace ( } ). Each name is surrounded by double-quotes and followed by a colon ( : ); the name/value pairs are separated by commas ( , ).
- An ordered list of values, also known as an array. An array is an ordered collection of values, beginning with a left bracket ( \[ ) and ending with a right bracket ( ] ). Values are separated by commas ( , ).

All JSON results are encoded as UTF-8. For more information on JSON, please see [http://www.json.org](http://www.json.org/).

The following example displays the JSON results for a song in the iTunes Store:

```
{"wrapperType":"track", "kind":"song", "artistId":909253, "collectionId":120954021, "trackId":120954025, "artistName":"Jack Johnson", "collectionName":"Sing-a-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George", "trackName":"Upside Down", "collectionCensoredName":"Sing-a-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George", "trackCensoredName":"Upside Down", "artistViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=909253", "collectionViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=120954025&id=120954021&s=143441", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=120954025&id=120954021&s=143441", "previewUrl":"http://a1099.itunes.apple.com/r10/Music/f9/54/43/mzi.gqvqlvcq.aac.p.m4p", "artworkUrl60":"http://a1.itunes.apple.com/r10/Music/3b/6a/33/mzi.qzdqwsel.60x60-50.jpg", "artworkUrl100":"http://a1.itunes.apple.com/r10/Music/3b/6a/33/mzi.qzdqwsel.100x100-75.jpg", "collectionPrice":10.99, "trackPrice":0.99, "collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit", "trackExplicitness":"notExplicit", "discCount":1, "discNumber":1, "trackCount":14, "trackNumber":1, "trackTimeMillis":210743, "country":"USA", "currency":"USD", "primaryGenreName":"Rock"} 
```
